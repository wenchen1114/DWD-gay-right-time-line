## Project Abstract & Description

In May 24th, 2019, Taiwan legalized Same-Sex Marriage, making it the first country in Asia to perform same-sex marriage. In fact, the history of gay rights in Taiwan can be traced back to 1986, as Chia-Wei Chi petitioned to Taipei court. Inspired by other data visualization of gay rights in the U.S, I decided to make an interactive timeline of history of Same-Sex Marriage in Taiwan. This website includes three parts: Timeline, Information and sign-up. The whole visual is a vertical timeline that people can look through it by scrolling down and up, also the website will provide more specific information through interaction. on the bottom of the website, there is a sign up button for people to access more news and information about LGBTQ rights in the world.

## Data collecting

Since there is no comprehensive data about same-sex marriage of Taiwan written in English, so I decided to collect data from different websites and translate it into English. At first, I attempted to include the whole history of LGBTQ rights movement, and found that it will be too much for one-week project because of the amount of data. So I decided to narrow down the sale and focus on the history of Same-Sex Marriage. That being said, I will also include some important movements and incidents so as to support the structure of the timeline.
